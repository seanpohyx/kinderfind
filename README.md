# kinderfind
A CZ2006 Software Engineering Assignment. For this project, we created an android application that allows parents to locate the nearest kindergarten that is best for their children. They are able to rate and give feedbacks for other parents to view.

We used the dataset from https://data.gov.sg. However that data was removed. 

We took that data and built an api for it

## Tools used for this development:
* Android studio - java
* Firebase
